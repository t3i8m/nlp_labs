# NLP Course Projects

This repository contains practical lab work and reports for an NLP (Natural Language Processing) course, organized by modules. Each lab explores core NLP concepts using Python and Jupyter Notebooks and has a detailed report.

## üìö Book
This repository also includes our book:
NLP Is All You Need: The Ultimate NLP Guide,
written by Nichita Bulgaru and Timur Jerƒçaks.

The book provides a practical and theory-backed overview of essential NLP techniques covered throughout this course ‚Äî from classic methods to modern transformer-based systems.
