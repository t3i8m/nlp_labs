    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

      "(Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty ... By: Nicole Winfield, Associated Press Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI comes home on Thursday to a new house and a new pope, as an unprecedented era begins of a retired pontiff living side-by-side with a reigning one inside the Vatican gardens. All eyes will be on Benedict's physical state as he is welcomed by Pope Francis at his new retirement home, a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica. The last time he was seen by the public - March 23 - Benedict appeared remarkably more frail and thin than when he left the Vatican on his final day as pope three weeks earlier. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, has acknowledged Benedict's post-retirement decline but insists the 86-year-old German isn't suffering from any ailment and is just old. ``He is a man who is not young: He is old and his strength is slowly ebbing,'' Lombardi said this week. ``However, there is no special illness. He is an old man who is healthy.`` Since his Feb. 28 resignation, Benedict has been ''hidden to the world`` as he himself predicted, living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills south of Rome. He chose to leave the Vatican immediately after his resignation to physically remove himself from the process of electing his successor and from Pope Francis' first weeks as pontiff. His absence also gave workers time to finish up renovations on the monastery on the edge of the Vatican gardens that until last year housed groups of cloistered nuns who were invited for a few years at a time to live inside the Vatican to pray for the pontiff and church at large. In the small building, with a chapel attached, Benedict will live with his personal secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, and the four consecrated women who look after him, preparing his meals and tending to the household. Inside the small building, Benedict has at his disposal a small library and a study. A guest room is available for when his brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, comes to visit. ''It is certainly small but well-equipped,`` Lombardi said. When Benedict announced his intention to resign - the first pontiff to do so in 600 years - questions immediately swirled about the implications of having two popes living alongside one another inside the Vatican. Benedict fueled those concerns when he chose to be called ''emeritus pope`` and ''Your Holiness`` rather than ''emeritus bishop of Rome.`` He also raised eyebrows when he chose to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy. Given the political intrigues that plague the Vatican, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination to wonder if some cardinals, bishops and monsignors - not to mention ordinary Catholics - might continue making Benedict their point of reference rather than the new pope. However, Benedict made clear on his final day as pope that he was renouncing the job and pledged his ''unconditional reverence and obedience`` to his then-unknown successor. It was a pledge he repeated in person on March 23 when Francis went to have lunch with him at Castel Gandolfo. It was during that visit that the world saw how frail Benedict had become in the three weeks since his emotional departure from the Apostolic Palace: Always a man with a purposeful walk, he shuffled tentatively that day, using his cane. Francis, for his part, seems utterly unfazed by the novel situation unfolding. He has frequently invoked Benedict's name and work and has called him on a half-dozen occasions, making clear he has no intention of ignoring the fact that there's another pope still very much alive and now living on the other side of the garden from the Vatican hotel where he lives. Francis' gestures to Benedict during that March 23 visit were also remarkable: He refused to pray on the special papal kneeler in the small chapel of Castel Gandolfo, preferring to join Benedict on a kneeler in the pews, and referring to his predecessor as his ''brother.`` Now that they're neighbors, they might bump into one another on walks in the Vatican gardens or at the shrine to the Madonna on the top of the hill, just a stone's throw from Benedict's new home.\n",

For example: if we search 'elephant', then a sentence with a few occurrences of this word is definetely about the elephant itself, whether 1 occurrence might be encountered in the description of the zoo, etc. So, it is kind of a loophole to get a 'semantic search' (which means that the phrase we are looking for is indeed the main topic of the sentence). Due to this reasoning, I will not implement it. \n",

      "Nicole Scherzinger wants a big family Updated: 04:58, Sunday September 2, 2012 Nicole Scherzinger hopes to have lots of kids in the future and is looking to Gary Barlow, her co-star on 'The X Factor' for advice.\n",
      "(Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty ... By: Nicole Winfield, Associated Press Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI comes home on Thursday to a new house and a new pope, as an unprecedented era begins of a retired pontiff living side-by-side with a reigning one inside the Vatican gardens. All eyes will be on Benedict's physical state as he is welcomed by Pope Francis at his new retirement home, a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica. The last time he was seen by the public - March 23 - Benedict appeared remarkably more frail and thin than when he left the Vatican on his final day as pope three weeks earlier. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, has acknowledged Benedict's post-retirement decline but insists the 86-year-old German isn't suffering from any ailment and is just old. ``He is a man who is not young: He is old and his strength is slowly ebbing,'' Lombardi said this week. ``However, there is no special illness. He is an old man who is healthy.`` Since his Feb. 28 resignation, Benedict has been ''hidden to the world`` as he himself predicted, living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills south of Rome. He chose to leave the Vatican immediately after his resignation to physically remove himself from the process of electing his successor and from Pope Francis' first weeks as pontiff. His absence also gave workers time to finish up renovations on the monastery on the edge of the Vatican gardens that until last year housed groups of cloistered nuns who were invited for a few years at a time to live inside the Vatican to pray for the pontiff and church at large. In the small building, with a chapel attached, Benedict will live with his personal secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, and the four consecrated women who look after him, preparing his meals and tending to the household. Inside the small building, Benedict has at his disposal a small library and a study. A guest room is available for when his brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, comes to visit. ''It is certainly small but well-equipped,`` Lombardi said. When Benedict announced his intention to resign - the first pontiff to do so in 600 years - questions immediately swirled about the implications of having two popes living alongside one another inside the Vatican. Benedict fueled those concerns when he chose to be called ''emeritus pope`` and ''Your Holiness`` rather than ''emeritus bishop of Rome.`` He also raised eyebrows when he chose to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy. Given the political intrigues that plague the Vatican, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination to wonder if some cardinals, bishops and monsignors - not to mention ordinary Catholics - might continue making Benedict their point of reference rather than the new pope. However, Benedict made clear on his final day as pope that he was renouncing the job and pledged his ''unconditional reverence and obedience`` to his then-unknown successor. It was a pledge he repeated in person on March 23 when Francis went to have lunch with him at Castel Gandolfo. It was during that visit that the world saw how frail Benedict had become in the three weeks since his emotional departure from the Apostolic Palace: Always a man with a purposeful walk, he shuffled tentatively that day, using his cane. Francis, for his part, seems utterly unfazed by the novel situation unfolding. He has frequently invoked Benedict's name and work and has called him on a half-dozen occasions, making clear he has no intention of ignoring the fact that there's another pope still very much alive and now living on the other side of the garden from the Vatican hotel where he lives. Francis' gestures to Benedict during that March 23 visit were also remarkable: He refused to pray on the special papal kneeler in the small chapel of Castel Gandolfo, preferring to join Benedict on a kneeler in the pews, and referring to his predecessor as his ''brother.`` Now that they're neighbors, they might bump into one another on walks in the Vatican gardens or at the shrine to the Madonna on the top of the hill, just a stone's throw from Benedict's new home.\n",

    "As I found 8 useful examples in BOW, here I am going to just go over them and describe how well does the algorithm tackle them and what\n",
    "is the difference with simple BOW.\n",
    "1) **fox and deer**: TF-IDF performs much better and I can say quite well because it ignores 'and' due to its overall frequencies in the texts. Results are relevant, unlike with BOW.\n",
    "2) **Chinese planes**: TF-IDF performs better, because the essense if the query is of course more so in the word 'plane', and it finds examples with planes. BOW, on the contrary finds nothing related to airplanes. Seamntically, TF-IDF obviously can not find the most suitable examples with chinese airlines. Even though TF-IDF is more advanced, it still has no tool to understand semantics. \n",
    "3) **china airlines**: Here TF-IDF performs worse then BOW because it considers airlines a less popular word then China, so the first example it finds is related to just airlines (there are 3 occurrences of 'airlines' there). It is a bad result, considering that there is a really suitable sentence about china airlines that BOW finds easily.\n",
    "4) **reply**: Here TF-IDF doesn't perform well, because once again it can not understand semantics and find synonyms. At the same time, BOW performs the same, it finds pretty much the same sentences. \n",
    "5) **respond**: We just need this query to check that there are sentences with a synonym to 'reply'\n",
    "6) **asian Elephant**: TF-IDF performs the same as BOW, it doesn't put the most relevant result on the first place. Also, here we can see that the second placed result is not on the first place beacause it is really long. Also, 'elephant' is probably more rare than 'asian', otherwise asian might have been on the first place. \n",
    "7) **Zosel Dam Lake Osoyoos**: Both algorithm worked well here because their principle is basically the same. \n",
    "8) **preventive**: Both algorithms didn't find sentences with this word, even though it is in the testing subset. TF-IDF has no advancements over BOW that helps it tackle new words. \n",
    "9) **blood pressure**: Both algorithms performed poor here, because TF-IDF doesn't have any functionality to take compound phrases into consideration. In order to fix that we would need to add bigrams.\n"

    "**Taking these facts into consideration, I can state that TF-IDF is better for this task.**"

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."

    "(10p) Complete the function below that takes as input the sentence in the form of tokens (so it's a list of words) and calculates the sentence embedding vector. First, we would need to retrieve the word embeddings for each word from our loaded model and then average the vectors.\n",

    "### Results and comparison\n",
    "As I found 9 useful examples in BOW and TF-IDF, here I am going to just go over them and describe how well does the Sentence embedding algorithm tackle them and what is the difference with BOW and TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  **fox and deer**: Sentence Embedding performs worse than TF-IDF. It finds sentences about deer or hunting but completely misses the \"fox\" component. The averaging seems to lose the specific meaning of the combination and defaults to the general topic of animals or just \"deer\". BOW was irrelevant, TF-IDF found sentences with either word.\n",
    "2)  **Chinese planes**: Sentence Embedding performs better semantically than both BOW and TF-IDF. It consistently finds results related to the topic of aviation (planes, jets, helicopters, flights), often including relevant airlines, even if \"Chinese\" isn't the main focus. BOW focused only on \"Chinese\", and TF-IDF found some plane results but less topically consistent.\n",
    "3)  **china airlines**: Here Sentence Embedding performs very well, arguably better than BOW and TF-IDF, even though it doesn't put the most relevant answer on the first place. Interesting thing here is that it considered Dragonair from Hong-Kong to be more related to the query than sentences with literal phrases 'China airlines'. So it captured the concept well, not just exact word matches.\n",
    "4)  **reply**: Sentence Embedding shows mixed results. It finds some exact matches like BOW and TF_IDF, but also retrieves sentences with related meanings (\"resignation\", \"tweeted\", \"deny\"). It shows semantic understanding but loses the precision for the exact keyword compared to BOW/TF-IDF, and introduces some noise. So, the first results that it finds don't have exact word 'reply'. Here I should highlight that searching for just one word like that might not be the best idea.\n",
    "5)  **respond**: We need this just to compare, so skipping.\n",
    "6)  **asian Elephant**: Sentence Embedding performs alright semantically. It captures the combined concept, finding results about Asian/Sumatran elephants, baby elephants, and related topics like poaching. The first result is exactly abpit asian elephants, unlike in other 2 methods. Nevertheless, the sentence 'The San Diego Zoo is loaning two female Asian elephants to the Los Angeles Zoo for its new $42-million Elephants of Asia exhibit set to open in mid-December, officials at the two zoos announced Friday.' is not found by this algorithm due to big length (as we remember we just average the similarity with every word), so we can conclude that this exact model has troubles with big sentences with a lot of words.\n",
    "7)  **Zosel Dam Lake Osoyoos**: Sentence Embedding performs much worse than BOW/TF-IDF. The results are generic about dams and lakes completely losing the specific names, because \"Zosel\" and \"Osoyoos\" are oov for Glove. Averaging defaults to the common words. BOW/TF-IDF rely on lexical matching and would be better here if the terms are in their vocabulary. So, it is bad for finding specific names. \n",
    "8)  **preventive**: Sentence Embedding performs significantly better. While BOW/TF-IDF found nothing (there was an error due to vector being zero), embeddings found relevant sentences about preventive medicine. This shows its strength in using semantic context to find meaning even for less common words which are not in the corpus we made out of training subset.\n",
    "9)  **blood pressure**: Sentence Embedding performs not quite good for that one, just as previous algorithms. Even though it finds semantically related sentences (unlike some of the results of previous algorithms that just retrieved sentences where 'blood' word has multiple occurrences) about the medicine, it doesn't find specific phrase as 'blood pressure'. That is the limitation of this approach as we are treating words separately here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Sentence Embeddings (using averaging) clearly perform differently by focusing on meaning over exact words. It excels in understanding topics and synonyms where BOW/TF-IDF fail. However, the simple averaging technique causes problems with specific phrases, oov words and sometimes leads to irrelevant results. **Taking these facts into consideration, while promising for semantic tasks, this simple averaging method isn't consistently better than TF-IDF for this specific retrieval task*\n",
    " where lexical overlap is often important and specific terms can be OOV."

    "\n",
    "In this last section we will try to evaluate how good our sentence retrieval system is. To keep the computational resources manageable, we will use the test set for that as its size is more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture in IR that there are several metrics to evaluate retrieval performance by taking into account the relevance of the retrieved results to the query. We will use Recall@K here (for more metrics and more details refer to the lecture slides and the textbooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "RRecall@K is a metric used to measure the effectiveness of a search system in retrieving relevant documents within the top $K$ retrieved documents. It calculates the proportion of relevant documents retrieved within the top-$K$ results, compared to the total number of relevant documents in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Recall@K} = \\frac{\\text{Number of relevant documents retrieved in the top }-K}{\\text{Total number of relevant documents}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have a sentence, and it's compressed version. To test our system, we will treat compressed sentences as the queries. Each query will have only a single relevant sentence - the corresponding uncompressed sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for the calculation of Recall@K we will take into account whether the correct retrieved result is contained within the first $K$ retrieved results. For example, if for a query (i.e. a compressed sentence) we retrieve 10 results and within these we see the relevant one (i.e. the full sentence), then Recall@10 = 1."

    "##### Formulation of the task\n",
    "If we consider some real task to retrieve information then of course we usually will retrieve it with some specific phrases or whole sentences and not just words, so some of our previous examples for testing will be exlucded.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Modelling\n",
    "We obviously want to stick to embeddings, because retrieving semantically close things is the most important part of any search and other methods can not offer that.\n",
    "If one wants to perform a normal search on that kind of data, we will need a sentence embedder (real sentence embedder, not just word embedder with averaging), because we are working exactly with sentences. It will let us extract a normal semantics from sentences and we don't have to worry about the number of words, etc. - it is not an important factor in sentence embeddings. As such an embedding we selected 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' because it is light and perfomative. (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like semantic search. We will not change the method to compare similar sentences because cosine similarity is the easiest and is really effective and interpretable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreation of results\n",
    "Above you can see that, if we, for example, are trying to look up news about certain topics or regarding certain phenomenas, it works perfectly, every query gets exactly what requires from it. Now let's try our examples from pervious exercices. \n"

    "1) fox and deer: Sentence Embedding performs well. It retrieves sentences explicitly about a \"fox\" and a \"deer\" separately within the top results, along with other animal-related sentences (\"badgers\", \"cows\"). While it understands the individual concepts well, it doesn't strictly enforce the co-occurrence of both \"fox\" and \"deer\" in the very top hits as strongly as a lexical search might aim for. It avoids being misled by common words like BOW and offers more thematic relevance than TF-IDF which might just match individual terms.\n",
    "2) Chinese planes: Sentence Embedding performs excellently, clearly understanding the core topic. All top results are directly relevant, mentioning China/Chinese alongside aviation terms like \"aircraft\", \"jets\", and specific airlines. This semantic understanding is far superior to BOW  and TF-IDF.\n",
    "3) china airlines: Here Sentence Embedding performs excellently. It retrieves results explicitly mentioning \"China Eastern Airlines\" and \"Air China\", as well as related contexts like Airbus deals in China. Its ability to understand the context and specific entities surpasses the keyword based limitations of the previous methods.\n",
    "4) asian Elephant: Sentence Embedding performs quite well semantically. It retrieves sentences about \"Sumatran elephant\" and \"Borneo pygmy elephant\", capturing the \"elephant\" theme and relevant geographical context (which are Asian regions). This is more nuanced than BOW/TF-IDF which would rely on exact term matches. It successfully identifies the core concept, but it didn'f put the most obvious and related result on the first place. \n",
    "5) Zosel Dam Lake Osoyoos: Sentence Embedding achieves outstanding performance here, retrieving the exact matching sentence as the top result. Subsequent results are thematically related to dams and lakes. This is a significant improvement over glove averaging (which failed due to oov) and demonstrates the transformer's ability (possibly via subword tokenization) to handle specific named entities better than expected for a purely semantic model, outperforming BOW or TF-IDF in this specific instance.\n",
    "6) blood pressure: Sentence Embedding performs well, retrieving sentences that explicitly mention \"blood pressure\" and closely related medical concepts like \"hypertension\" and relevant studies. It understands the combined concept, unlike BOW/TF-IDF which might have focused on individual word occurrences."
