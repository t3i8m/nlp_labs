    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data.

    "In this section we will implement the TF-IDF algorithm. While BOW is a simple way to represent the documents, it has some limitations. For example, it does not take into account the importance of each word in the document. TF-IDF representation takes into account the frequency of each word in the document and the frequency of the word in the whole dataset. It is a widely used technique in information retrieval and text mining. Refer to the lecture slides for more details."

    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
