The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data. It involves creating a vocabulary of unique words from the dataset and representing each sentence as a vector of word counts. We first need the vocabulary, which we will build from both the full sentences and the compressed sentences. Similar to the first lab, the vocabulary will be a list of unique words from the dataset."

      "(Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty ... By: Nicole Winfield, Associated Press Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI comes home on Thursday to a new house and a new pope, as an unprecedented era begins of a retired pontiff living side-by-side with a reigning one inside the Vatican gardens. All eyes will be on Benedict's physical state as he is welcomed by Pope Francis at his new retirement home, a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica. The last time he was seen by the public - March 23 - Benedict appeared remarkably more frail and thin than when he left the Vatican on his final day as pope three weeks earlier. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, has acknowledged Benedict's post-retirement decline but insists the 86-year-old German isn't suffering from any ailment and is just old. ``He is a man who is not young: He is old and his strength is slowly ebbing,'' Lombardi said this week. ``However, there is no special illness. He is an old man who is healthy.`` Since his Feb. 28 resignation, Benedict has been ''hidden to the world`` as he himself predicted, living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills south of Rome. He chose to leave the Vatican immediately after his resignation to physically remove himself from the process of electing his successor and from Pope Francis' first weeks as pontiff. His absence also gave workers time to finish up renovations on the monastery on the edge of the Vatican gardens that until last year housed groups of cloistered nuns who were invited for a few years at a time to live inside the Vatican to pray for the pontiff and church at large. In the small building, with a chapel attached, Benedict will live with his personal secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, and the four consecrated women who look after him, preparing his meals and tending to the household. Inside the small building, Benedict has at his disposal a small library and a study. A guest room is available for when his brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, comes to visit. ''It is certainly small but well-equipped,`` Lombardi said. When Benedict announced his intention to resign - the first pontiff to do so in 600 years - questions immediately swirled about the implications of having two popes living alongside one another inside the Vatican. Benedict fueled those concerns when he chose to be called ''emeritus pope`` and ''Your Holiness`` rather than ''emeritus bishop of Rome.`` He also raised eyebrows when he chose to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy. Given the political intrigues that plague the Vatican, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination to wonder if some cardinals, bishops and monsignors - not to mention ordinary Catholics - might continue making Benedict their point of reference rather than the new pope. However, Benedict made clear on his final day as pope that he was renouncing the job and pledged his ''unconditional reverence and obedience`` to his then-unknown successor. It was a pledge he repeated in person on March 23 when Francis went to have lunch with him at Castel Gandolfo. It was during that visit that the world saw how frail Benedict had become in the three weeks since his emotional departure from the Apostolic Palace: Always a man with a purposeful walk, he shuffled tentatively that day, using his cane. Francis, for his part, seems utterly unfazed by the novel situation unfolding. He has frequently invoked Benedict's name and work and has called him on a half-dozen occasions, making clear he has no intention of ignoring the fact that there's another pope still very much alive and now living on the other side of the garden from the Vatican hotel where he lives. Francis' gestures to Benedict during that March 23 visit were also remarkable: He refused to pray on the special papal kneeler in the small chapel of Castel Gandolfo, preferring to join Benedict on a kneeler in the pews, and referring to his predecessor as his ''brother.`` Now that they're neighbors, they might bump into one another on walks in the Vatican gardens or at the shrine to the Madonna on the top of the hill, just a stone's throw from Benedict's new home.\n",

    "4) We can not count multiple occurrences of the word (so, make a simple rule: if this word occurred in the sentence x times -> it still counts as 1 in the embedding), but on average it is a bad practice. For example: if we search 'elephant', then a sentence with a few occurrences of this word is definetely about the elephant itself, whether 1 occurrence might be encountered in the description of the zoo, etc. So, it is kind of a loophole to get a 'semantic search' (which means that the phrase we are looking for is indeed the main topic of the sentence). Due to this reasoning, I will not implement it. \n",

    "8) First, we can increase the vocabulary size. But if the word is completely not encountered in training subset, it is a different issue. In order to solve that issue we need to understand the semantics of the word which we don't have in our voacbulary, but considering our approach, it is not really reasonable."

      "(Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty ... By: Nicole Winfield, Associated Press Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI comes home on Thursday to a new house and a new pope, as an unprecedented era begins of a retired pontiff living side-by-side with a reigning one inside the Vatican gardens. All eyes will be on Benedict's physical state as he is welcomed by Pope Francis at his new retirement home, a converted monastery tucked behind St. Peter's Basilica. The last time he was seen by the public - March 23 - Benedict appeared remarkably more frail and thin than when he left the Vatican on his final day as pope three weeks earlier. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, has acknowledged Benedict's post-retirement decline but insists the 86-year-old German isn't suffering from any ailment and is just old. ``He is a man who is not young: He is old and his strength is slowly ebbing,'' Lombardi said this week. ``However, there is no special illness. He is an old man who is healthy.`` Since his Feb. 28 resignation, Benedict has been ''hidden to the world`` as he himself predicted, living at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills south of Rome. He chose to leave the Vatican immediately after his resignation to physically remove himself from the process of electing his successor and from Pope Francis' first weeks as pontiff. His absence also gave workers time to finish up renovations on the monastery on the edge of the Vatican gardens that until last year housed groups of cloistered nuns who were invited for a few years at a time to live inside the Vatican to pray for the pontiff and church at large. In the small building, with a chapel attached, Benedict will live with his personal secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, and the four consecrated women who look after him, preparing his meals and tending to the household. Inside the small building, Benedict has at his disposal a small library and a study. A guest room is available for when his brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, comes to visit. ''It is certainly small but well-equipped,`` Lombardi said. When Benedict announced his intention to resign - the first pontiff to do so in 600 years - questions immediately swirled about the implications of having two popes living alongside one another inside the Vatican. Benedict fueled those concerns when he chose to be called ''emeritus pope`` and ''Your Holiness`` rather than ''emeritus bishop of Rome.`` He also raised eyebrows when he chose to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy. Given the political intrigues that plague the Vatican, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination to wonder if some cardinals, bishops and monsignors - not to mention ordinary Catholics - might continue making Benedict their point of reference rather than the new pope. However, Benedict made clear on his final day as pope that he was renouncing the job and pledged his ''unconditional reverence and obedience`` to his then-unknown successor. It was a pledge he repeated in person on March 23 when Francis went to have lunch with him at Castel Gandolfo. It was during that visit that the world saw how frail Benedict had become in the three weeks since his emotional departure from the Apostolic Palace: Always a man with a purposeful walk, he shuffled tentatively that day, using his cane. Francis, for his part, seems utterly unfazed by the novel situation unfolding. He has frequently invoked Benedict's name and work and has called him on a half-dozen occasions, making clear he has no intention of ignoring the fact that there's another pope still very much alive and now living on the other side of the garden from the Vatican hotel where he lives. Francis' gestures to Benedict during that March 23 visit were also remarkable: He refused to pray on the special papal kneeler in the small chapel of Castel Gandolfo, preferring to join Benedict on a kneeler in the pews, and referring to his predecessor as his ''brother.`` Now that they're neighbors, they might bump into one another on walks in the Vatican gardens or at the shrine to the Madonna on the top of the hill, just a stone's throw from Benedict's new home.\n",

    "As I found 8 useful examples in BOW, here I am going to just go over them and describe how well does the algorithm tackle them and what\n",
    "is the difference with simple BOW.\n",
    "1) **fox and deer**: TF-IDF performs much better and I can say quite well because it ignores 'and' due to its overall frequencies in the texts. Results are relevant, unlike with BOW.\n",
    "2) **Chinese planes**: TF-IDF performs better, because the essense if the query is of course more so in the word 'plane', and it finds examples with planes. BOW, on the contrary finds nothing related to airplanes. Seamntically, TF-IDF obviously can not find the most suitable examples with chinese airlines. Even though TF-IDF is more advanced, it still has no tool to understand semantics. \n",
    "3) **china airlines**: Here TF-IDF performs worse then BOW because it considers airlines a less popular word then China, so the first example it finds is related to just airlines (there are 3 occurrences of 'airlines' there). It is a bad result, considering that there is a really suitable sentence about china airlines that BOW finds easily.\n",
    "4) **reply**: Here TF-IDF doesn't perform well, because once again it can not understand semantics and find synonyms. At the same time, BOW performs the same, it finds pretty much the same sentences. \n",
    "5) **respond**: We just need this query to check that there are sentences with a synonym to 'reply'\n",
    "6) **asian Elephant**: TF-IDF performs the same as BOW, it doesn't put the most relevant result on the first place. Also, here we can see that the second placed result is not on the first place beacause it is really long. Also, 'elephant' is probably more rare than 'asian', otherwise asian might have been on the first place. \n",
    "7) **Zosel Dam Lake Osoyoos**: Both algorithm worked well here because their principle is basically the same. \n",
    "8) **preventive**: Both algorithms didn't find sentences with this word, even though it is in the testing subset. TF-IDF has no advancements over BOW that helps it tackle new words. \n",
    "9) **blood pressure**: Both algorithms performed poor here, because TF-IDF doesn't have any functionality to take compound phrases into consideration. In order to fix that we would need to add bigrams.\n"

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."
